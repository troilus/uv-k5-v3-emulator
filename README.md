# UV-K5 V3 emulator

Runs Quansheng UV-K5 V3 / UV-K1 firmware on a PC. The radio uses a Puya
PY32F071 (Cortex-M0+), which QEMU has no machine for, so this adds one.

The firmware boots to its main loop in about five seconds, the LCD contents are
readable, and the keypad drives the menus. See [Status](#status) for what is and
is not modelled.

| Main screen | Menu | Navigated with keys |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ![main VFO screen](docs/screenshots/main-vfo.png) | ![menu at Step](docs/screenshots/menu-step.png) | ![menu at BatSav](docs/screenshots/menu-batsav.png) |

Real captures, not mock-ups: `tools/screenshot.py` reads the firmware's
`gFrameBuffer` out of guest memory and renders it, so these are the pixels the
LCD driver actually wrote. Left to right: the dual-watch main screen, the menu
opened with `key.py MENU`, and entry 30/79 reached with keypresses.

## What it is for

Editing firmware and reflashing a radio to test one line is slow, and some bugs
are invisible from the outside. A recent example: CW macro recording appeared to
do nothing, and the cause was three layers down -- the keyer was being torn down
by a later call that recomputed its state from the wrong VFO. On hardware you see
"nothing happens"; here you can read the actual variables.

What it does **not** do is model radio behaviour. It reproduces what the firmware
*commanded* -- frequency, power step, carrier keying in time -- not the analogue
result. Keying envelopes, spurious emissions and sensitivity need a real radio and
a spectrum analyser. That is not a gap to be closed later; the transceiver chip
has no public datasheet, so its driver is the only specification available.

## Status

| Area | State |
| --- | --- |
| Boot to main loop | works, ~5 s |
| LCD contents | readable via `tools/screenshot.py` |
| SPI flash, settings, calibration | works |
| Keypad and menu navigation | works while the radio is awake; power save stops the scan, see below |
| Timing accuracy | deliberately wrong, see [Timing](#timing) |
| Radio/RF behaviour | not modelled |

A short `tools/key.py MENU` opens the menu, UP/DOWN move through it, MENU enters
a submenu, and typing a menu number jumps straight to that entry. Press duration
decides short versus held, which the firmware treats as different events -- see
[Timing](#timing).

The limitation is power save. Around six seconds after boot the firmware enters
it (`gCurrentFunction` becomes `FUNCTION_POWER_SAVE`) and stops scanning the
keypad, so keys are ignored from then on. A real radio wakes on a keypress, so
this is a gap in the machine model rather than firmware behaviour.

In practice it is not much of an obstacle: keypad activity keeps the radio awake,
and being in the menu blocks power save entirely. Open the menu within the first
few seconds of boot and the session stays usable. `AGENTS.md` has the details,
including two approaches that look like fixes and are not.

## Building

Needs a QEMU 7.2 source tree, `meson`, `ninja`, `libfdt-dev`, `libglib2.0-dev`,
`libpixman-1-dev`.

    # 1. Drop the sources into a QEMU tree
    cp qemu/py32f071.c                   $QEMU/hw/arm/
    cp qemu/armv7m_systick.c.patched     $QEMU/hw/timer/armv7m_systick.c
    cp qemu/armv7m_systick.h.patched     $QEMU/include/hw/timer/armv7m_systick.h

    # 2. Register the machine. In $QEMU/hw/arm/Kconfig:
    #      config UVK5_V3
    #          bool
    #          default y
    #          depends on TCG && ARM
    #          select PY32F071_SOC
    #      config PY32F071_SOC
    #          bool
    #          select ARM_V7M
    #          select UNIMP
    #    In $QEMU/hw/arm/meson.build:
    #      arm_ss.add(when: 'CONFIG_UVK5_V3', if_true: files('py32f071.c'))

    # 3. Build just the ARM target
    cd $QEMU
    ./configure --target-list=arm-softmmu --disable-docs --disable-tools
    cd build && ninja qemu-system-arm

## Running

    python3 tools/make_flash.py     # once, builds assets/flash.img
    tools/run.sh                    # starts the machine

    tools/where.sh                  # where the firmware is executing
    python3 tools/screenshot.py --frame-addr 0x200013DC \
        --status-addr 0x2000175C --port 1234 --out screen.png
    python3 tools/key.py MENU       # inject a keypress
    tools/gpiob_dump.sh             # GPIOB registers

The machine exposes a GDB stub on port 1234 and a QMP socket on TCP port 4444.
It is headless: the screen is read out of guest memory rather than drawn, so no
display backend is needed.

## Running on Windows

### Option 1: Built-in GUI (recommended)

Download the latest `uvk5-v3-windows-x64.zip` from
[GitHub Releases](../../releases), extract it, and place your firmware file
(`firmware.elf` or `firmware.bin`) in the same directory.  Double-click
`uvk5.exe` -- a window appears showing the LCD and on-screen buttons.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Arrow keys | UP / DOWN / LEFT / RIGHT |
| Enter | MENU |
| Escape | EXIT |
| F | F key |
| S | STAR key |
| Space | SIDE1 |
| Shift | SIDE2 |
| 0-9 | Number keys |

You can also click the on-screen buttons with the mouse.

### Option 2: Command-line tools

Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and the UCRT64 toolchain, then build
from source using `tools/build-windows.sh`.  The Python tools (key.py,
screenshot.py, etc.) work on Windows with Python 3 -- they use TCP instead of
Unix sockets by default.

    python tools/key.py MENU
    python tools/screenshot.py --frame-addr 0x200013DC \
        --status-addr 0x2000175C --port 1234 --out screen.png

Screenshots need the addresses of `gFrameBuffer` and `gStatusLine`, which move
between builds. Find them with:

    arm-none-eabi-nm firmware.elf | grep -E 'gFrameBuffer|gStatusLine'

## How the machine is put together

Register layouts come from the vendor CMSIS header shipped with the firmware
(`Drivers/CMSIS/Device/PY32F071/Include/py32f071xB.h`), not from guesswork.

    FLASH  0x08000000  128 KB   application at +0x2800, bootloader below it
    SRAM   0x20000000   16 KB
    RCC    0x40021000
    GPIO   0x50000000   ports A, B, C, F at 0x400 intervals
    SPI1   0x40013000   display
    SPI2   0x40003800   flash
    ADC1   0x40012400

Modelled: RCC, GPIO, ADC, both SPI controllers, DMA1, and the PY25Q16 flash.
Everything else answers through a logging catch-all — the log is how the next
thing worth modelling gets identified.

Seven things had to be right before the firmware would boot, each found by
watching where it stopped:

- **Flash alias at the application offset.** The core fetches its vector table
  from address 0, and the image loads at 0x08002800, so 0 has to alias there and
  not at the flash base.
- **Clock ready bits.** `BOARD_Init` polls them; each enable bit is mirrored into
  its ready bit.
- **ADC calibration.** `CR2.CAL` is write-1-to-start and hardware-cleared, so it
  must never be stored set or the wait loop never exits.
- **SPI flags.** Transfers complete inside the register write, so TXE stays
  asserted and RXNE is raised by the write.
- **DMA.** The flash driver never touches the SPI data register — it arms
  channels 4 and 5, enables the transfer-complete interrupt and spins on a flag
  its ISR sets.
- **SysTick.** See below.
- **Transceiver data line.** `RADIO_SetupRegisters` waits for bit 0 of the
  BK4819 REG_0C to clear. The bus is bit-banged over GPIO, so PB9 idles low until
  that bus has a real model, making reads return zero.

## Timing

`SYSTICK_DelayUs` polls the SysTick counter and accumulates differences. On
hardware each loop iteration advances the counter by tens of ticks; under
emulation a register read costs far more relative to guest time, so the counter
barely moves per read. Measured: a 120 ms delay advanced 832 of 5,760,000
required ticks in four seconds — about 7.7 hours to complete.

Lowering the clock does not help, which is worth knowing before trying it: the
bottleneck is loop iterations per second, not counter speed. Dropping 48 MHz to
200 Hz gained only 32x.

What works is reporting a counter value that runs ahead of the real one, growing
with every read. The `poll-boost` property on SysTick does that. Two earlier
attempts wrote the value back into the timer instead, which made each read
re-anchor the count — the reported value stopped changing, the firmware's
`if (cur != prev)` guard never fired, and the loop hung outright.

The consequence is that guest time runs fast during any delay. Fine for
exercising menus and control flow; wrong for judging signal timing.

`poll-boost` accelerates counter **reads** only. SysTick **interrupts** still
fire at close to real time, and those are what drive `SysTick_Handler` ->
`gNextTimeslice` -> `APP_TimeSlice10ms` -> `CheckKeys`. So the firmware's 10 ms
timeslice thresholds hold in wall clock: a key must be down for 20 ms to
register and 400 ms makes it a long press.

Keeping those two apart matters. `tools/key.py` originally held keys for 2500 ms
on the assumption that guest time ran fast here too, which turned every press
into a long press. Handlers that act on a short release — `MAIN_Key_MENU` among
them — ignored all of it, and the keypad looked broken when it was not.

## Stage A: the CW timing chain on the host

`harness/`, `stubs/`, `shim/` and `tests/` compile `app/cwkeyer.c` and
`app/cwmacro.c` unmodified against stub drivers, with a virtual clock and
scripted paddle input. Feed a timeline of contact closures, assert on the decoded
characters and element durations.

Firmware sources are compiled as-is on purpose. Editing them to make them build
on a host would let the tests drift from what the radio runs. The debounce in
`CW_ReadKeys` is transcribed rather than stubbed, because its asymmetry (three
consecutive reads to register a press, immediate release) is part of the timing
behaviour under test.
